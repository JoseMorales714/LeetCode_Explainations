# Leet_Pointers

This is a repo that has challenges from leetcode to help programmers understand prompts and how to approach them

If you would like to contribute to this repo and help other programmers, please do the following
  -> write comments on files that do not already have comments, then provide helpful documentation 
  -> if you would like to provide additional leetcode challenges, then please do so. However, the challenges need to 
    originate from "Leetcode 75 study plan" -> https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/
